project-dotfiles
================

Personal central repository for common dotfiles that individual projects might use.

In order to keep those separate projects up-to-date, a shell script is provided to:

 * Allow the user to choose which dotfiles to copy into their project at the start.
 * Choose which updates to the central dotfiles should be incorporated along the way.

Run the script for more help information.
